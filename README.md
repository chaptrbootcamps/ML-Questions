The approach to week one is in two ways, first you will use the knowledge learnt to measure your own understanding of vectors and matrices. 
Secondly, you will be expected to write a 2-3 page summary of the aplications of AI in an industry of your choice. The instructions are listed below. 


## 1. ML-Questions
- First, download the notebook into your environment, to be able to view the math questions in clarity(they are not rendered appropriately on the github notebook) 
- Answer the questions in the belwo codeblock of each question. 
- Upload your answer to the repostiory and share a link as appropriate for technical mentor review. 
- In case of having challenges in completing the task, log that and schedule a technical mentro session to go through the same. 

## 2. Applications of ML 
You will be expected to choose from the below industries and elaborate on the different aspects of ML emplpoyed in the specific industry: 
- Healthcare 
- Software Enginnering 
- Image and Computational Photography
- Banking 
- Commerce 
- Manufacturing 
- Chip Design 
- Etc

In your write up, be sure to cover the following themes
- Introduction 
- Why traditional methods are not feasible to handle these problems 
- What changes in the AI landscapa have enabled these applications 
- Which algorithms are employed for (the problems in the chosed industry - use one example eg in the banking sector, which algorithms are used in fraud detection) 
- Data Sources 
- Examples of these applications in our Kenyan context. 
- The challenges faced in general faced in using these models.
